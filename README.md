Programming Assignment 1 Insertion Sort Analysis

## 1. Implement Insertion Sort

Count the number of key comparisons and assignments for various inputs and plot the graph for both of them.

► For every input size n, run it with 10 different sets of data points generated randomly.

► Compute the minimum, maximum and average of the number of key comparisons (and assignments) for each input size.

Plot the graph for each case - best, worst and average number of comparisons (and assignments).

n varies from 10 to 100 in steps of 5.

In the sample data, n is shown to vary from 3 to 5 in step of 1. For each value of n, 3 different sets of data points have been shown.

The program has been implemented in python for the simplicity of creating graph using matplot
